# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

This project implements a Python-based anomaly detection system for a continuous data stream that simulates real-world scenarios like financial transactions or system metrics.

## Key Features
- **Data Stream Simulation**: Simulates data with regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise.
- **Anomaly Injection**: Introduces different types of anomalies into the data stream.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses a simple threshold-based algorithm to detect anomalies.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Plots the data stream and highlights the detected anomalies.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
